      <title>Debug in Hugo</title>

      <description>While building this website I needed to understand a bit more about the internals and its variables. Eventhough Hugo&amp;rsquo;s documentation about debugging is pretty &amp;ldquo;okay&amp;rdquo;, there are a lot of attributes that are really hard to figure out, specially if you can&amp;rsquo;t see them on the documentation.
So I started to look online for something to help me out debugging Hugo templates and the usual 3 options were:
 🖨 printing the dot on Hugo&amp;rsquo;s templates 📝 console.</description>

      <description>Since this #remotelife began, sadly not for the best reasons, I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to finally clean my backlog of, guess what, TV Shows, Games, Podcasts, Books&amp;hellip; Well, everything that a person is suppose to do!
Very happy was I until I remembered that, maybe I should start looking into the &amp;ldquo;To Read&amp;rdquo; bookmarks, &amp;ldquo;Saved&amp;rdquo; on Reddit and, the holy grail, &amp;ldquo;Read Later&amp;rdquo; of Feedly.
While the &amp;ldquo;Saved&amp;rdquo; section on Reddit was mostly threads from /r/cscarrearquestions (and some memes from /r/wsb 😂) the other two places were actual interesting articles that I have planned on reading.</description>

      <description>More often than not, I endup going online to look up on how to use docker as the middle man on interacting with Postgres.
 Usually for me its Postgres, but this &amp;ldquo;recipe&amp;rdquo; can be applied to any piece of software that has more than one version which you don&amp;rsquo;t have installed on your laptop.
 Because of this whole back&amp;amp;forth I compiled a small list of &amp;ldquo;how-tos&amp;rdquo; to help me remember.</description>

      <title>SSH ForwardAgent Gotchas</title>

      <description>So, you’re trying to create an SSH Tunnel to your remote machine to make some gitlab/github clones.
That’s all fine and well until you don’t want to post your password on to the terminal.
First, look at you ~/.ssh/config file and add the “ForwardAgent yes” to that machines ip.
1 2 3  Host 35.241.133.24 IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa ForwardAgent yes   That says to use your local private key as identification when accessing gitlab on your remote’s machine.</description>

      <description>My macbook has OSX Mavericks installed and sometimes it crashes for no reason, breaking my local postgres server. After restarting and running again &amp;quot;$ brew services postgres&amp;quot;, Postgres becomes yellow and I end up spending sometime looking confused and frustrated.
Looking at the logs you can get a sense of whats happening:
1 2  $ tail -f /usr/local/var/postgres/server.log FATAL: lock file &amp;#34;postmaster.pid&amp;#34; already exists   Simply removing the lock file that Postgres generates solves this issue:</description>

      <description>Well, after reading a couple of books on the topic, they all talk about the same thing: you should diversify your portfolio.

The first parameter of the shortcode is the name. - There is a syntax error. check browser console.   function draw(){ test = document.getElementById(&#34;piechart&#34;); if (test == null){ console.log(&#34;The plot name is not defined&#34;</description>

      <description>My key takeaways from making this website &amp;ldquo;SEO friendly&amp;rdquo;:
 Use link &amp;ldquo;tree structure&amp;rdquo; from homepage. This way, bots and crawlers can find every page on the website Good titles, under 65 characters Meta tags with good keywords under 100 characters Use canonical urls on every page  1 2 3  &amp;lt;link rel=&amp;#34;canonical&amp;#34; href=&amp;#34;http://localhost:1313/blog/seo-tips/&amp;#34;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;!-- instead of --&amp;gt; &amp;lt;link rel=&amp;#34;canonical&amp;#34; href=&amp;#34;/blog/seo-tips&amp;#34;&amp;gt;   Add &amp;ldquo;alt&amp;rdquo; tag to images  1  &amp;lt;img alt=&amp;#34;About me picture&amp;#34; src=&amp;#34;/images/about.</description>

      <description>Yes I know it sounds dumb but, if during your working hours you go to the toilet, technically, you are getting paid for it. 💩
Use case Alright, lets say you you earn $10 an hour and during those 8 hours of daily work, you go twice to the bathroom, for around 10 minutes each time.
Then a simple multiplication shows that your &amp;ldquo;poop time&amp;rdquo; is worth around $3.34 per day!</description>
